## Legal information

The `grbcce.sty` package is Copyright Gordon R. Bower as mentioned in the files.
Reproduced with permission.
All changes, reformatting and cleanup, as well as the cards themselves (in both source and final form) is my copyright.
Permission to copy the PDF files granted for any bridge use, in particular for my partners and opponents.
Permission to use any of the tex files as a template for your own cards granted, provided my and my partner's names and numbers are replaced.
 - Everything in the `orig` folder is exactly what is available at [Gordon's site](https://taigabridge.net/latex/grbcce.htm) (apart from whitespace).
 - Everything in the `template` folder is what I use for my cards.  This includes:
   - Spelling and formatting fixes, automatic red diamonds and hearts.
   - Version date and advertising for GRB and LaTeX.
 - grbccemf.sty is a special "template" that tweaks the base card for South African Texas:
   - 4C transfers to Hearts, 4D to spades
   - Red Alertable rather than Blue Announceable
