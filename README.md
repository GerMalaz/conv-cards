 - Everything in the `template` folder is what I use for my cards.  This includes:
   - Spelling and formatting fixes, automatic red diamonds and hearts.
   - Version date and advertising for GRB and LaTeX.
   - Colour changes to match 2021 Alert/Announcements.
 - grbccemf.sty is a special "template" that tweaks the base card for South African Texas:
   - 4C transfers to Hearts, 4D to spades

Feb 2022 update: Added the new 2022 ACBL convention card legal in June.  It is still in
draft format, and may be incomplete, or badly kerned.  I have made a couple of small changes 
that either feel righter or "since I have the space anyway..." and one big change: I have removed
all the guide lines, as all they do with printed text is clutter the card.  I may add a
tikz layer with all the guide lines for preference, or to print blank cards for manual filling out.  I may not.
