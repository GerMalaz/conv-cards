### Notes for Michael Farebrother - Ellen Kuiper

1. 1NT is 12-14 all seats, all vulnerabilities.  We upgrade especial 11s (Michael more than Ellen).  
   1. We do *not* play Stayman over 1NT.  2&clubs; is Keri: a puppet to 2&diams;. This is forced; there is no other systemic response to 2&clubs;.  Responder's rebids:
      - Pass: Weak with Diamonds
      - 2&hearts;: INV with 4 *or 5* hearts (but see Note 1.iii below)
      - 2&spades;: INV with 4 *or 5* spades
      - 2NT: GF Puppet Stayman.  Specialized responses.
      - 3&clubs;: INV with 6+ clubs
      - 3&diams;: INV with 6+ diamonds
      - 3M: GF, 5+ *diamonds* and 4 of the major
      - 3NT: Mild diamond slam try.  Usually 5332 or 6322.
   2. We do *not* play Gerber.  Over 1NT and 2NT, 4m transfers to corresponding major, 4M is to play.
   3. Other special responses over 1NT:
      - 1NT-2&diams;: hearts, very rarely 4 if responder rebids 2&spades;: INV  and 5&spades;-5&hearts;, 5&spades;-4&hearts; or 4&spades;-4&hearts;.
      - 1NT-2&spades;: Range ask. Responder's suit rebid is RKC (3NT: xx, then 4&clubs;: "don't care, Keycard.")
      - 1NT-3suit: GF, 3-suited, short in *the next suit up*.  Bidding the short suit shows no wasted values and max, 3NT promises good stoppers.
      - 1NT-4NT: 0123 Blackwood.  *Not* quantitative.
   4. Our runout system is "2&clubs; Scramble":
      - Almost all calls, including Pass and XX, are natural and to play.  Keri and Transfers are off.
      - XX sets a force through 2&diams;.
      - The exception is 2&clubs;, which is "Natural", but 1+.  This call is to play undoubled.  If doubled:
        - Opener will pass with 3+ clubs, or bid her lowest 4-card suit.
        - Responder will pass with 4+ clubs, or bid her lowest 4-card suit.
        - Runs are also to play unless doubled, or if a 7 card fit is found.  Further bidding as above.

      We play this over _all_ doubles, conventional or penalty, direct or balancing.
   5. We play systems on over 2&clubs; overcalls (again, no matter what they mean).  Double is Keri.  
      We play Lebensohl after higher interference, with Negative doubles always.  
      When dealing with a forcing "X or Y" interference, we may choose to bid directly, or wait for clarification and Lebensohl over that.
   
2. We play Power Doubles and 1NT Overcall for takeout:
   1. (1suit)-X shows "any" 15+, but because we will pass for penalty with much weaker trumps than "normal", with a singleton, it's about 17, and with a void, about 19.
      - It frequently shows a strong NT, with or without stoppers.
      - Next suit up (exc. 1&spades;-X) is an artificial negative, 0-bad 4 any.
      - Non-jump bids are natural and about good 4-bad 8.
      - 1NT is good 4-7 basically balanced, and implies, but does not promise, a stopper.
      - Cuebid is good 8+, GF
      - Jump bids are good suits.
   2. (1suit)-1NT is takeout, usually 8-14 HCP, guaranteeing 3+cards in all unbid suits.
      - With perfect shape, especially NV in 2nd, could be on 6 (Open chart only).
      - With a singleton (16) or void (18) in bid suit, we may overcall 1NT with more than 14 HCP.
      - We are fairly aggressive with this call, and can do it with 5 card suits; but with 4333, we will be on the top of the range.
      - Pass is rare, but possible.
      - New suits are natural and to play.
      - Cuebid is Stayman-esque, and could be the start of a Game Inv+ sequence.
      - Jump bids are preemptive, exc. INV at unfavourable.
      - After X, new suits are to play (usually 5+), XX shows 4 cards in the highest unbid suit, and pass is any other (*not* to play).
3. We play Fit Jump Shifts (9+ in bid suit and partner's, about limitish values) even by unpassed hand without competition.
4. In many situations where we show two known or one known and one unknown suit, 2NT is strong and asking, and cheapest unknown suit is pass/correct.  This applies to:
   - Woolsey overcalls of 1NT
   - Michaels cuebids
5. We play Upside Down Attitude, Count *and Suit Preference*.  Suit preference is the default secondary signal, and we play Trump Suit Preference.
   Against NT, we play Reverse Smith Echo (if attitude is not known to opening leader's suit, signal to trick 2 is (upside down) attitude in leader's suit, not a signal about declarer's suit).
6. Our preempt style is more aggressive than most, heavily dependent on vulnerability and seat:
   - NV first seat weak 2s could be Jxxxxx.  Second seat vulnerable, the minimum is probably KJ9xxx.
   - Similar arguments apply to 3- and 4-major bids, and 3NT (4 level minor preempt, *not* gambling).
   - Exception is 3&clubs; and 3&diams; in first and second seat, which are "happy to put dummy down in 3NT", and 4-minor Namyats (solid 8 and nothing, or 1Loser 8 with an outside A or K).
   - We are similarly aggressive with jump overcalls and preemptive raises.
